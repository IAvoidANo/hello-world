# hello-world
this is me starting to code after 25 years of doing other things 
so lets begin with some editing of docuemnts
I'm hoping to sort out the website coding by the end of the evening and then we can commit it and go live
hoping to prove my coding skills
without the hassel of having to justify my existance
then tomorrow ot will all be good and I will have a cool site without any issues and push back
I will alos have to clena up the study
